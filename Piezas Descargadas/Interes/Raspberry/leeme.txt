Instructions
Each layer should be approx 66mm by 99mm by 3mm thick when cut.

Black and Green lines are essential cuts

Orange lines are convenience cuts for better material release

Red and Cyan lines are etched areas, but may be 'kiss' cut for speed

The thin GPIO release section on layers 5 and 6 may warp during cutting under excessive laser heat.
Practice makes perfect.

This design may change as the design for the Raspberry Pi is refined and updated.

You can buy the case direct from us at pibow.com to support our work, and the development of future projects.

We've released this design under CC BY-NC-SA so those with access to tools can make their own Pibow and learn from the design to make exciting new things themselves.

We've gone for non-commercial for now to protect our business from clones. Yes, we know we're not hardcore enough :)
