Instructions

You have to choose between a version with 2mm wall thickness and another with 3mm.
I think the 2mm version is stable enough, but you have the choice.

Further there is an edge, which can be glued at the plate to prevent the phone to drop off.
It´s not really necessary, but it is a minimal effort.
