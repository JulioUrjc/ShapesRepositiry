I've had to make the stacker drawer slightly narrower to keep the Tardis the same shape.

I've also improved the base of the drawers so that they stick to the build platform by more surface area but still stack.

I left the door stop on the original upload, if you downloaded that one, you can always just cut it off (I did!).

I'll turn off work in progress when I've posted the rest of the drawer types.

Update:

The double height draw was too high, I've uploaded a new one.

I'm going to turn off the Work In Progress flag, these drawers work, let me know if you want one of the others and I'll generate it.

I have got a derivative that's nearly ready with a chess board embedded in the bottom of the 6 drawers. I'll post that as a new item rather than adding it here.
