The ZIP includes the OpenSCAD source. The OpenSCAD source is not an example of good programming. Just hacked together for fun.

There is a logo on the bottom, you can delete that or replace it with one you like.

1) Print.

2) You might need to sand or tweak the lid slightly. With my printer it goes together right off the build platform, but I had to tweak quite a bit to make that happen.

3) Try to remember when you thought little boxes with parts in them were cool.

4) After you give up, let a kid have it, they still think little boxes with parts in them are magic.

5) Wonder if the little pieces will break the vacuum as they rattle through it.
