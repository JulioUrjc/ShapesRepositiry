Instructions
1. Print the main STL file, you can split off the joint block if you want that a different colour (mine is black on a red X-wing).

2. Possibly need to drill out the axle and gun holes to 3mm.

3. Print the Accessories in a contrasting colour (glow in the dark PLA works REALLY well).

4. Use 3mm PLA (or something similar) as axles

5. Assemble pieces, its all pretty obvious. Longer guns go at the top as the holes are not blocked by a PLA axle.

6. I Glued it all together with Superglue to be sure it stayed but it will probably stay together without this.

7. Give to child ... watch them break it. (The derivative has yet to be tested on my nephew!)
